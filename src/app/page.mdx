# Hey Code Cracker ðŸ¥ 

> Cracking code is like opening a fortune cookie: surprises inside, wisdom to guide, and challenges to grow.

Code Cracker was born from my own need to document common `JavaScript algorithms`, something I missed when learning them myself. But instead of keeping it to myself, I thought: why not turn it into something fun and useful for others, too?

Inside every "cookie," you'll find successes to celebrate, lessons to learn, and algorithms that challenge you to think differently. With editable code examples and instant feedback, it's a playful way to explore and grow your skills.

So, crack open the cookie, dive into the algorithms, and see where the code takes you.
