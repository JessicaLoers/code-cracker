## Common Sorting Algorithms

Below is a list of sorting algorithms covered in this chapter. Each algorithm includes an explanation, code examples, and challenges to reinforce your understanding.

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple but inefficient algorithm, great for understanding basic concepts.
2. **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element and places it at the start.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Inserts each element in its correct position within a sorted section.
4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer approach that splits arrays into smaller parts and merges them in sorted order.
5. **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array using a pivot.

## Quick Overview of Time Complexity

| Algorithm      | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) |
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n²)      |
